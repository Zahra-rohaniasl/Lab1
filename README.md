Introduction to Tidy data & Tidyverse syntax in R.

Tidy Data:
A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative).

Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation.

A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.
